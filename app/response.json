I resonate with Eric‚Äôs thought, I don‚Äôt think everyone should take it literally as the phrase he said about ‚Äúsuffering doesn‚Äôt means success so we shouldn‚Äôt glorify it‚Äù<br><br>I believe suffering might be part of growing and the process, so we don‚Äôt really have to avoid it in life. But if you suffer because you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs your goal is, that‚Äôs a problem. I think when sharing his thoughts on ‚Äúsuffering on being a good Asian Student‚Äù, he wasn‚Äôt had a clear goal yet, so getting to Harvard after all of the efforts and sacrifices feels depressing.<br><br>On my own experience, life might be full of regrets. Someone who had work hard during study year even sacrificing their social/play time for focusing on lesson might regret it because they might have limited ‚Äúfriend and fun memories‚Äù even though they got a job before graduating. While the other who had spend more time for connecting with other even by sacrificing their study time might regrets their decision because it‚Äôs hard for them to land a job (on a certain work field) or maybe lacking acknowledgment from their family, even though they got tons of other opportunities through their connection. I believe when they have a clear or better goals in mind, their sacrifices tho it‚Äôs hard it will feels bearable and fulfilling than an endless suffering of life üòä",
